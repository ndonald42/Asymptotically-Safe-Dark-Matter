# Asymptotically Safe Dark Matter with Gauged Baryon Number
We consider the inclusion of TeV-scale, fermionic dark matter in an asymptotically safe model of gauged baryon number that has been recently proposed [Phys. Rev. D 106, no. 3, 035015 (2022)]. The new gauge boson serves as a portal between the dark and the visible sectors. The range of the baryon number gauge coupling and the kinetic mixing between baryon number and hypercharge are constrained by the requirement that nontrivial ultraviolet fixed points are reached. We show that this asymptotically safe dark matter model can achieve the correct dark matter relic density while remaining consistent with direct detection bounds. A PDF of the arXiv publication is provided in the repository.
# File 1: SM_U1_DM_CS
This is a Mathematica notebook which loads FeynCalc software to compute the total s-channel annihilation cross section for two dark matter particles in the model to annhilate into standard model particles. A quick estimate in the non-relativistic limit of the dark matter relic density is also performed.
# File 2: RGE analysis (gaussian).py
RGEs are generated from PyR@TE3 software in C++. This python file first solves the system of coupled differential equations below the Planck scale where gravitational corrections can be ignored and uses initial conditions specified in the Gaussian fixed-point case. The values of the couplings at the Planck scale are then used to set the initial conditions for the RGEs above the Planck scale with the gravitational corrections now taken into account. Plots of the running of the couplings above and below the Planck scale are produced for the couplings in each sector of the model. The RGEs are slightly different than in the gauged baryon number repository since this project includes the dark matter candidate.
# File 3: RGE analysis (non-trivial).py
RGEs are generated from PyR@TE3 software in C++. This python file first solves the system of coupled differential equations below the Planck scale where gravitational corrections can be ignored and uses initial conditions specified in the non-trivial fixed-point case. The values of the couplings at the Planck scale are then used to set the initial conditions for the RGEs above the Planck scale with the gravitational corrections now taken into account. Plots of the running of the couplings above and below the Planck scale are produced for the couplings in each sector of the model. The RGEs are slightly different than in the gauged baryon number repository since this project includes the dark matter candidate.
